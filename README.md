This is a repository of my teaching, organising my local filesystem and distributing everything via git so that there is no single point of failure.

All folders and files are mirrored on [Github](https://github.com/et0and/teaching), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), and [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~tomupom/teaching).
